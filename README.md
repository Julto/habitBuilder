How to install:

Install NodeJs: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager

Clone this repository through git clone

cd into the new folder created, and run npm install to install packages

Run "npm run dev", which should give you a link to the local webpage

In another terminal, run "node server.js" to start the backend

You can change the backend through "config.js", and you can change which backend server you want to connect to through "frontendConfig.ts", which is set to '127.0.0.1', or localhost, right now.
